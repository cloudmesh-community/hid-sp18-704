    When you think of Netflix you probably don't think about big data. You
    think about streaming videos and being watching the newest series. How
    they keep you watching and a happy customer is through their use of big
    data. Not only does Netflix use big data for their external customers
    they use it for their internal customers. Netflix use of big data
    analytics has given them strong customer insight and internal
    applications to help keep their systems up and running and striving for
    the four nines availability. The uptime of 99.99% which they strive for
    and have tried to uphold very well.

Introduction
============

Netflix was once a small start up company, trying to compete with
Blockbuster and Hollywood Video. It's main goal was to allow customers
to get DVD's through the mail without having to go in store. They
expanded their services through distributing an API to other companies
to encourage streaming and coming back to their site. That originally
turned out to be a failure, but then they started to see the value in
streaming, and started to allocate major resources in that direction.
From there they became a big data giant in the movie streaming business.

Brief History
=============

There is no doubt you have not heard of Netflix, but their climb to
where they are now has been a journey of failure and strife. Netflix
once was a DVD only shipping business, but soon started experimenting
with streaming by pushing out their API to other companies to drive
business back to them. However this had been a huge failure, but through
that they found value in streaming on their own. They started building
teams and software to create to handle the data they encountered and
originally started with their own infrastructure as well to host this
service. Eventually they saw value in the use of micro services and the
use of amazon web series as a solid company structure. Eventually they
started living exclusively in the cloud. With that they faced many
challenges but they knew that the pro's out weight the con's and pushed
forward into the new frontier of cloud computing and micro service
industry. Netflix now has almost 100 million views in almost every
country around the globe. However, they plan to push for more customers.
They plan to dedicate 1 billion dollars to acquiring new customers. It
is uncertain what the future hold for Netflix but one can bet that it
will involve big data, and that is what will drive them forward.[@Marr]

The Revolution of the Genre
===========================

If someone wanted to count how many genres were out there for movies,
they would be able to count it easily. However, when Netflix was looking
for a way to create better data so they could create better suggestions
to retain customers, they revolutionized that system. Gone are the days
of simplistic genres of the past created by Hollywood. Now are the days
of 76,897 to categorize movies according to Netflix. [@Madrigal] Soon
this grew into much more.

The Netflix Quantum Theory
--------------------------

This was a document in which was created to come up with a method of
tagging movies with genres. In this case they were called micro genres.
This set out to distinguish movies from one another while making it
easier for a generator to put together movies someone would most likely
watch based on the genres provided. Such as quirky movie or romantic
comedy featuring the rock. Does that actually exist? If it did, Netflix
Quantum Theory Generator would produce something like that to get people
to watch it. This is the basis for their predictive algorithm which they
are always fine tuning to provide value to their customers.

Internal Use of Big Data
========================

Their is no doubt of use for big data to help customers find the movies
they would like to watch. However that is only one side of the issue.
For Netflix to be effective they need to be able to take the data they
get back from the customers and turn it into something tangible and
usable, so they can keep creating value for their customers. This is
included in their use of content creation, not just the utilization of
the license agreement from the movie companies. They use all of this
information to keep track of their ecosystem of micro services as well
as see what users are doing and how to better serve them. Due to their
overwhelming size and use of data, Netflix had to get creative and start
thinking on better ways to collect and push this data across all their
internal teams to produce a company that works in harmony.

Atlas
-----

Atlas is essentially the monitoring tool that Netflix uses to make their
operation work. They implemented this system back in 2013 and it has
been running since. It allows for easy time series queries to beget back
valuable data that scales. They did this by simplifying the structure of
the data and the query structures. In addition most of this data was
kept in memory so it as easily accessible so as not have to access a
database and slow down the process. This allows the data to be pulled
quickly from many different services that demand the data. [@Netflix]

Visualization
-------------

It is one thing to understand the data from a mathematical and
theoretical level. However that only helps those who are easily
associated with it. At Netflix, if it is not visualized then it doesn't
serve a purpose. Which cover the three ways Netflix views data.

-   Data should be accessible, easy to discover, and easy to process for
    everyone.

-   Whether your dataset is large or small, being able to visualize it
    makes it easier to explain.

-   The longer you take to find the data, the less valuable it
    becomes.[@Simon]

With these view you can see how Netflix want to accurate rich accurate
data. Not only that but make it better. Something a normal person can
look at, and be able to make a informed decision. For instance, in the
case of choosing a new shows title picture. They put out different
version and see what gets chosen, and all the characteristics of why
that particular one was chosen. Was it based off color, people in it,
typography. They can usually those data points to help pick the best
picture to have people watch that show. That is one of the key drivers
for why their business has continued to flourish.

Micro services
--------------

Not only does all of this data help identify shows customer want to
watch by informing the employee, but it also helps them run a better
system. Netflix would be nothing without the data they are able to
obtain for their ecosystems of micro services. The essential lifeblood
of their operation platform. With the use of big data they can fin tune
how they run their micro services and help maintain the four nines of
uptime the hold themselves to. With this data, they spot what services
are essential for the product to still run, though it may be limited.
They also use a lot for testing suits for different types of failures in
production under load. These then allow them to get data back on how the
system performed and how to fix it without actually breaking anything at
all.

Conclusion
==========

In conclusion, this is only a small view of what makes Netflix a Big
Data giant. They have faced many other issues in the past and over come
them with agility. Normally if a company grew this fast it would start
to get really messy and make some possibly bad decisions based of their
data. Just ask UBER about that type of situation. However, that issue
may have been to lack of leadership and planning more than anything. In
any case Netflix has adapted and conquered and now is a model for many
other platforms out there such as amazon video and apple TV. Whether or
not the will get to the level of Netflix is possible, but the real
question is, by the time they get to that level, where will Netflix
be?[@Evans]
