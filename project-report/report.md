## Abstract

The medical field has long been collecting data from various sources.
Previous to the revolution in big data, the information collected had be
siloed in doctors' offices and shared when only requested. This leaves
an incomplete profile of patients for any doctor not familiar with the
patient. This is information is critical to quality care, and of the
highest importance in emergency situations where, knowing the patient's
history could mean the difference between life and death. Within the
last decade this movement towards data driven decisions for patients
care. The purpose of this paper to explore the many aspects in which
health industry is utilizing data to make healthcare cheaper, more
efficient, and allow for better patient care. 

## Introduction

Before the data revolution in the medical field started to gain
popularity, data was being collected with paper files and hand-written
notes. Then those files were put into a record system where everything
was kept in office. This system worked well for the office where the
data was kept. However, what if the patient was out of town and had an
emergency and had a condition, or medication reaction that was crucial
to saving their life. The possibility of calling the primary care
physician of the patient is a possibility but there is the chance the
office is closed or, if they were able to get in contact with the office
finding the record and assessing the paper files in urgent matter could
take too long. The data revolution for the medical field does not only
benefit those who are in an emergency situation. There are many facets
to explore in the medical fields use and accrual of data. All of them
benefit the patients as well as the providers, doctors, and
pharmaceutical companies. With this new wealth of data this field had
push forward to share it standardize it and creating new opportunities
for care and prevention as well as strides in researching effective
treatments

## Advantages of Big Data analytics in healthcare

The healthcare industry's data is set to grow dramatically and shows no
signs for slowing soon. What does this mean for the industry though? In
order to keep up with trends and stay ahead of competitors healthcare
business will have to utilize the data that is being collected is used
to find meaningful business insight as well as beneficial insight into
research of diseases and treatment and so much more. This data can be
used to prevent diseases, understand which treatments that work best or
what surgeries are proven most effective for a certain medical issue. It
is estimated that the use of big data analytics could save over \$300
billion dollars a year for the healthcare industry.

## The Data

In most cases when it comes to big data, there is no easy way to deal
with it. The vast amount of data and the different types of data makes
it relatively difficult to sift through. Add in that all this data from
different applications and vendors starts to create a rather large issue
of how to standardize the data and to analyze it so one can make sense
of it and create a trend out of all of it. All of this data comes from a
clinical setting, claims and cost data, pharmaceutical research and
development data and patient behaviors and sentiment data. This is
excluding possible data from outside sources such as commercial health
tracking systems.

### Clinical data

Patients create a lot of data, ranging from the vitals they give when
they see a doctor such as blood pressure, temperature and body weight
and height to other information taken from test such as x-rays, blood
test, and MRI's. Again, this data used to be privileged to just the
primary care doctor's office. Now that is expanding. Many health
institutions are starting to create health profiles on patients. This
data that once was collected through forms and manually written is now
becoming digitized. Over the past decade all this medical data has been
becoming digitized to support the use of big data [@Groves2013]. With
this movement has come the creating of the Electronic Medical Record.
The creation of the Electronic Medical Record is a step forward in
creating real data profiles on patients. It allows for doctors to
investigate the patient's health history, access x-rays and lab data and
any relevant data with relative ease. This allows the doctors to manage
the patents care with relative ease. This allows them to efficiently
access notes on previous visits and see if treatments are working. It
creates effective prescription management, which not only makes it
easier for prescription filling and renewing but can also prevent for
duplicate orders and prevent possible exploitation of narcotics. Another
critical use of the Electronic Medical Record is its ability to prevent
prescriptions from being used that my have bad interactions with current
prescriptions. This data is especially important when time is a factor
and a doctor need to administer drugs in a medical emergency. It also is
critical to have this information available when starting new
prescriptions as well.

### Claims and Cost Data
This data comes from payor and provider of the service. This type of
data ends up being things such as the utilization of the care as well as
the cost estimate. This type of data could allow for cost comparisons as
well as the usage of the visits for patients and help cut out
redundancies and increase efficiencies.

### Pharmaceutical Research and Development
Pharmaceutical Research and development data is that is created by pharmaceutical
companies when they create clinical trials.  This data is extremely valuable to 
show if a drug is working well. However, there may be untapped data in the creation
of the drugs before it even makes it to clinical development.  Allowing for better
success rates in the development of drugs.

### Patient Behavior and sentiment Data
This data is the most indirect capture of data related to healthcare but all the same
crucial data.  Them most related information would be information from health
application and wearables that the patient would normally use for their benefit,
rather than a benefit for healthcare.  However, the use of the wearables such as
Fitbits and Apple watches give a lot of data.  This includes sleeping patterns,
heart rate, resting heartrate, exercise, caloric intake, sleep patterns.
This type of data outside normal clinical data can help give an all profile of a patient. 

### Data sharing
In order for data to be relevant and allow for trends to be seen, there
needs to be a fairly large sample size. Typically, this data is kept in
house and is collected at hospitals and doctors' offices. While this
data set is large, it is not nearly large enough. In order to create a
good sample of data one would want to aggregate as much as possible.
Realistically regional, or national data sets would work best until a
global effort is put forward to collect and utilize data from every
location possible. Until that day comes the best way to create these
data sets is by sharing findings at health-information exchanges. These
events allow the sharing of millions of electronic medical files.
However, for the patient's privacy all these records are stripped of
their names and any other type of identifiers. That allows for the data
to be safely shared with other physicians and those studying the data.
With this collection of data the ability to see what types of treatments
work for different types of people is helping develop specialize
treatment for individuals.

## Medical Internet of Things
The medical internet of things is an emerging field where data is
collected from devices on or near the patient. These devices have senor
that sense various things such as blood pressure, electrocardiograms,
movements and so much more. These devices can interact with the internet
and have results be viewed from anywhere the internet is available.
Currently available to everyone are smart wearables such as Fitbit or
apple watches. These commercial devices can give ample insight to a
patient's day to day lives so doctors can possibly help patients adjust
their life style to attain better health. These devices log you resting
heart rate, your exercise and steps taken, food intake, water intake,
weight gain or loss, sleeping schedule, and sleep quality. This
information alone can enable a physician to give corrective changes to
help someone lose weight or, sleep better at night or possibly spot a
potential problem by seeing their results. With medical internet of
things doctors' visits will become more efficient, less frequent. The
doctor will be able to monitor trends in recovery and treatment and
schedule appointments based on those trends. Even further still the
in-office appointment may become unnecessary due to virtual doctor
visits which can be done from the comfort of a patient's home. This
saves the doctors and patients time and money yet still allows for more
effective care than an in person visit.

### Doctors Visit
Under normal procedures a doctor visit can seem repetitive in nature.
First the vitals are taken, then a brief talk with the nurse over the
reason for the visit and then the doctor comes in and reviews the
information gives an examination and takes some sort of action. The
action could be a new prescription or possibly asking for some procedure
or lab to be done, or even possibly referring a specialist. All of these
tasks seem rather repetitive but soon the landscape of a doctor's
appointment will change. Doctors and nurses will have the medical
history and vitals all at the touch of screen. In a hypothetical
situation one could get the vitals taken care of, that information would
be uploaded to a secure database. That information then could be sent to
a central location where the electronic medical record could be
accessed. To which the nurse and doctor would have access and be able to
review and assess before even waling into the room. With this
information they will already have a general idea of the needs of the
patient and be able to take the correct actions quicker and more
efficiently [@Dimitrov2016].

### Evolution of Health Applications

It was not long ago, that if you had a problem that there was an
application out there that could not solve it. That stands true today.
Most health apps are for tracking goals as well as certain vitals, but
now the applications are pushing further beyond that. Now these health
applications are becoming more specialized. There is application company
named Canary Health which is specializing in prediabetes prevention. The
application changes the eating habits as well as physical activity of
the patient to become healthier and possibly no longer be prediabetic.
Applications such as this not only help patients get healthier and save
money. They also help the overall health care system preform better and
save them money as well in the process. Chronic diseases such as
Diabetes can cause a multitude of problems for patients and hospitals a
like. These applications if utilized correctly will help save lives and
unneeded expenses.


### Pharmaceuticals

As far as a place of pharmaceutical companies in medical internet of
things, they have decided to stay in a very specific segment of the
industry. Aside from prescriptions their main area of concentration is
through researching outcomes of drug usages. Using smart devices to
track clinical trials patient care allowing them to create more
effective products for patients. Pharmaceuticals is also pushing itself
beyond the use of just drug creation, now they are pushing for more
creative ways to implement and administer treatments. This includes the
use of sensor and hardware. For instance, instead of having to take
insulin for someone who is diabetic, what if there was a sensor that was
able to tell when the glucose levels were shooting up too high and had
something that automatically released insulin into the blood stream
without having the patient doing a single thing. Essentially curing the
disease in some manner, having sensors, medication and hardware work in
tandem to do what the body was originally intended to do. The
applications for this could be very helpful for seniors who forget to
take medication, or forgot they took medication. If there was an
automated system to release drug into the body, it could save seniors
from accidental overdose. In addiction these systems could help those
who have pain issues, manage their pain appropriately and possibly help
curb the opioid epidemic that is happening at the time of this paper.

## Data Mining

With all the data available there must be a way to make sense of it all.
This is done through data mining.  Data mining at its core is looking at
large amounts of data and extracting meaningful knowledge from it.
Usually patterns can be extrapolated form that a data to help predict trends,
or specific data points or events. Data mining usually is something that is
usually in done in tandem with Big Data analytics.  Big Data is based off the three
V’s which are volume, velocity and variety.  

When it comes to the complexity of healthcare data, big data almost sounds like to
small of a term.  There are large amounts of data that is being converted from past
records and combined with the ever-growing amount of data being produced makes this
data not just big, if anything massive is a better descriptor.  If you couple with that
the velocity of the information itself, which covers everything from real time, to batch
processes the data being collected very quickly.  Then to top it all off the variety of
healthcare data is quite extreme as well.  This means electronic medical records, pharmaceutical
studies, xrays, MRI’s, and an assortment of other types of data to work with.

With this Big data in the medical field, it is possible that there are a multitude of medical
discoveries waiting to be discovered.  At the very least there are some answers on how to improve
the healthcare experience allowing for cheaper and more effective healthcare than is known by today
standards. In fact, it seems that due to big data in healthcare the paradigm is shift from a
disease-centered model towards a patient-centered model.  


### Disease Centered Care
Before the revolutionization of big data in healthcare, physicians made decisions based
on several factors.  They had their educations, expertise and accrued wisdom, reference
books and cohorts to help draw logical conclusions to solve the patient’s issue.  Doctors,
being only human, are prone to error, and though highly trained can come to the incorrect
diagnoses. In some cases, this type of error can lead to death or unneeded labs and procedures
which can in turn cost either the hospital, doctor, or patient potentially large amounts of money.
This type of treatment while all that was available before the big data revolution is now shifting
towards patient centered care.

### Patient Centered Care
While Diseases centered care is more about knowledge that only physicians acquire and use to help
patients receive proper treatment; patient centered care is about allowing the patient to be more
in charge of their actual care.  While we will never replace doctors or the knowledge and skills 
they learn in the medical field, the way they provide treatment may change.  With patient centered 
care it is more about choices presented to the patient to decide how they wish to proceed with their
treatment and the doctor is a guiding professional.  This puts more responsibility on the patient to be
proactive about their healthcare, rather than just being told by a doctor what issues are being faced
and what to do to fix them.  

When it comes to patient centered care data is the key.  This means more personalized treatment not
based off population-based statics. This personalization would come from people who are similar to
the patient and the issues that they face and the treatments that worked best for them.  This type of
data gives the best choices for that type of person and not for the disease or issue itself.  


### CARE: A Patient-Centric Personalized Healthcare Framework

Here is a possible example with the use of data mining in big data to create a possible application
for patient centric healthcare.  This framework allows for patients to get an in-depth look into their
current health status.  Not only that but the possibility of future issues or complications they may
face based on their personal type of profile.  In addition, these assessments could allow the patient
to be vigilant and on the look out for warning signs of possible symptoms.  Though being able to spot
possibly predisposed diseases seems nice, these assessments would also include proactive step to 
possibly, reduce the risk of the disease or condition or possibly not getting the disease or condition
at all. 

How would this system be constructed and how would it function? The answer in this case is in the 
name itself.  Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine (CARE) [Chawla2013].  The premise of 
this framework is to create essentially a Netflix base data system in which the patient data from 
various others is aggregated and compared to the current patient’s information.  This allows for the 
patient type to see how other patients have developed certain diseases and what factors lead to it as 
well. 

The real question to ask for a product like this however is, will the patient use this data to change 
their health outcome?  Only time and data can help reveal if this use of data will produce outcomes. 
However, given the human species and most species are creatures are on of habit, the intended outcome 
may not succeed fully. Most will not act unless the situation is immediate, and currently affecting 
them.   That is not to say that this system will not have positive outcomes for some, just that the 
majority will do nothing with the information they are presented.  This model is something that would 
truly help in an ideal world where patients indeed take care of themselves.  



## Big Data Effects on Healthcare

Currently the healthcare system is extremely complex and rich full of
data. Though these complexities look to create challenges they also
offer the ability to do remarkable things. In using big data analytics
in the healthcare ecosystem, it will effectively change how care is now
delivered. These changes will affect every stake holder in the
healthcare ecosystem and create a positive change especially for the
patients.

These changes can drive change and can also be looked at as new types of
value pathways. These pathways help in delivering the best
cost-effective treatment for a patient, while creating the best outcome
for the patient. This allows healthcare system as a whole to operate
more efficiently but deliver the best result for the patient. Given the
pathways below it is possible to create better patient care, and lower
cost to the consumer as well as to the provider and healthcare system as
a whole.

Right Living:

* This value pathway is created by Patients actively taking part in
their own treatment. These are done through lifestyle changes
allowing them to remain as healthy as possible. This includes proper
diet and exercise to remain as healthy as possible. However, this
does include their active care, when they do become ill. With this
pathway the patient is taking control of their healthcare and only
seeing a doctor when needed while helping with their own disease
prevention and allowing the doctors to see those who are truly sick.

Right Care:

* This pathway concentrates on efficiencies in care for the patient.
The right care requires clear communication from providers to care
givers in which all the information is used to attain the same goal
for the patients care and thus avoid duplicate work saving time and
money for every party involved.

Right Provider:

* This pathway is setting up the match between the patient and
provided. Selecting the provider with the correct skill for the
issue that is presented. That is also coupled with those providers
who give the bask outcome for a problem given. This allows for quick
assessment of issues as well as quick resolving of the issue as
well.

Right Value:

* It is well known healthcare comes at a high cost. This pathway takes
aim at that problem. The goal of this pathway is to lower the cost
of healthcare while improving or sustaining over all care. This
means implementing cost-effective measures such as, reimbursing
providers based on patient outcomes, or eliminating waste, fraud and
abuse of the medical system.

Right Innovation:

* This pathway is to drive innovation in the medical field.
Essentially this is the change of the industry. Creating better ways
to test out drug's effectiveness before release of it in trials.
Better ways to treat patients with a certain disease. Better
surgical tools that are less invasive. This pathway has many
directions it can go, but it is the most effective way to initiate
positive change in the healthcare industry.
