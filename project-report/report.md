 ## Abstract

The medical field has long been collecting data from various sources.
Previous to the revolution in big data, the information collected had be
siloed in doctors' offices and shared when only requested. This leaves
an incomplete profile of patients for any doctor not familiar with the
patient. This is information is critical to quality care, and of the
highest importance in emergency situations where, knowing the patient's
history could mean the difference between life and death. Within the
last decade this movement towards data driven decisions for patients
care. The purpose of this paper to explore the many aspects in which
health industry is utilizing data to make healthcare cheaper, more
efficient, and allow for better patient care. 

## Introduction

Before the data revolution in the medical field started to gain
popularity, data was being collected with paper files and hand-written
notes. Then those files were put into a record system where everything
was kept in office. This system worked well for the office where the
data was kept. However, what if the patient was out of town and had an
emergency and had a condition, or medication reaction that was crucial
to saving their life. The possibility of calling the primary care
physician of the patient is a possibility but there is the chance the
office is closed or, if they were able to get in contact with the office
finding the record and assessing the paper files in urgent matter could
take too long. The data revolution for the medical field does not only
benefit those who are in an emergency situation. There are many facets
to explore in the medical fields use and accrual of data. All of them
benefit the patients as well as the providers, doctors, and
pharmaceutical companies. With this new wealth of data this field had
push forward to share it standardize it and creating new opportunities
for care and prevention as well as strides in researching effective
treatments

## Advantages of Big Data Analytics in Healthcare

The healthcare industry's data is set to grow dramatically and shows no
signs for slowing soon. What does this mean for the industry though? In
order to keep up with trends and stay ahead of competitors healthcare
business will have to utilize the data that is being collected is used
to find meaningful business insight as well as beneficial insight into
research of diseases and treatment and so much more. This data can be
used to prevent diseases, understand which treatments that work best or
what surgeries are proven most effective for a certain medical issue. It
is estimated that the use of big data analytics could save over \$300
billion dollars a year for the healthcare industry.

## Big Data Effects on Healthcare

Currently the healthcare system is extremely complex and rich full of
data. Though these complexities look to create challenges they also
offer the ability to do remarkable things. In using big data analytics
in the healthcare ecosystem, it will effectively change how care is now
delivered. These changes will affect every stake holder in the
healthcare ecosystem and create a positive change especially for the
patients.

These changes can drive change and can also be looked at as new types of
value pathways. These pathways help in delivering the best
cost-effective treatment for a patient, while creating the best outcome
for the patient. This allows healthcare system as a whole to operate
more efficiently but deliver the best result for the patient. Given the
pathways below it is possible to create better patient care, and lower
cost to the consumer as well as to the provider and healthcare system as
a whole.

Right Living:

* This value pathway is created by Patients actively taking part in
their own treatment. These are done through lifestyle changes
allowing them to remain as healthy as possible. This includes proper
diet and exercise to remain as healthy as possible. However, this
does include their active care, when they do become ill. With this
pathway the patient is taking control of their healthcare and only
seeing a doctor when needed while helping with their own disease
prevention and allowing the doctors to see those who are truly sick.

Right Care:

* This pathway concentrates on efficiencies in care for the patient.
The right care requires clear communication from providers to care
givers in which all the information is used to attain the same goal
for the patients care and thus avoid duplicate work saving time and
money for every party involved.

Right Provider:

* This pathway is setting up the match between the patient and
provided. Selecting the provider with the correct skill for the
issue that is presented. That is also coupled with those providers
who give the bask outcome for a problem given. This allows for quick
assessment of issues as well as quick resolving of the issue as
well.

Right Value:

* It is well known healthcare comes at a high cost. This pathway takes
aim at that problem. The goal of this pathway is to lower the cost
of healthcare while improving or sustaining over all care. This
means implementing cost-effective measures such as, reimbursing
providers based on patient outcomes, or eliminating waste, fraud and
abuse of the medical system.

Right Innovation:

* This pathway is to drive innovation in the medical field.
Essentially this is the change of the industry. Creating better ways
to test out drug's effectiveness before release of it in trials.
Better ways to treat patients with a certain disease. Better
surgical tools that are less invasive. This pathway has many
directions it can go, but it is the most effective way to initiate
positive change in the healthcare industry.

## The Data

In most cases when it comes to big data, there is no easy way to deal
with it. The vast amount of data and the different types of data makes
it relatively difficult to sift through. Add in that all this data from
different applications and vendors starts to create a rather large issue
of how to standardize the data and to analyze it so one can make sense
of it and create a trend out of all of it. All of this data comes from a
clinical setting, claims and cost data, pharmaceutical research and
development data and patient behaviors and sentiment data. This is
excluding possible data from outside sources such as commercial health
tracking systems.

### Clinical Data

Patients create a lot of data, ranging from the vitals they give when
they see a doctor such as blood pressure, temperature and body weight
and height to other information taken from test such as x-rays, blood
test, and MRI's. Again, this data used to be privileged to just the
primary care doctor's office. Now that is expanding. Many health
institutions are starting to create health profiles on patients. This
data that once was collected through forms and manually written is now
becoming digitized. Over the past decade all this medical data has been
becoming digitized to support the use of big data [@Groves2013HealthcareRevolution]. 
With this movement has come the creating of the Electronic Medical Record.
The creation of the Electronic Medical Record is a step forward in
creating real data profiles on patients. It allows for doctors to
investigate the patient's health history, access x-rays and lab data and
any relevant data with relative ease. This allows the doctors to manage
the patents care with relative ease. This allows them to efficiently
access notes on previous visits and see if treatments are working. It
creates effective prescription management, which not only makes it
easier for prescription filling and renewing but can also prevent for
duplicate orders and prevent possible exploitation of narcotics. Another
critical use of the Electronic Medical Record is its ability to prevent
prescriptions from being used that my have bad interactions with current
prescriptions. This data is especially important when time is a factor
and a doctor need to administer drugs in a medical emergency. It also is
critical to have this information available when starting new
prescriptions as well.

### Claims and Cost Data
This data comes from payor and provider of the service. This type of
data ends up being things such as the utilization of the care as well as
the cost estimate. This type of data could allow for cost comparisons as
well as the usage of the visits for patients and help cut out
redundancies and increase efficiencies.

### Pharmaceutical Research and Development
Pharmaceutical Research and development data are created by pharmaceutical
companies when they create clinical trials.  This data is extremely valuable to 
show if a drug is working well. However, there may be untapped data in the creation
of the drugs before it even makes it to clinical development.  Allowing for better
success rates in the development of drugs.

### Patient Behavior and Sentiment Data
This data is the most indirect capture of data related to healthcare but all the same
crucial data.  Them most related information would be information from health
application and wearables that the patient would normally use for their benefit,
rather than a benefit for healthcare.  However, the use of the wearables such as
Fitbits and Apple watches give a lot of data.  This includes sleeping patterns,
heart rate, resting heartrate, exercise, caloric intake, sleep patterns.
This type of data outside normal clinical data can help give an all profile of a patient. 

### Government Influence
There is a massive amount of data in the healthcare industry alone, but there is a saying that 
more is better’ and with data that is always true.  In the United States, the federal government 
has created many initiatives to make healthcare data available to the public in order to improve 
the cost and quality of healthcare for all of the parties involved.  With government the healthcare 
industry has made large strides in becoming a big data business.  Before its involvement, most of 
the healthcare industry was not nearly as digitized as is now. The US government created massive 
incentives for healthcare business to switch to Electronic Medical Records which hold enormous 
value in terms of data.  These incentives also allowed for infrastructure upgrades and training for 
the electronic medical record.

In addition to incentives, the opening of government data has allowed for a look into government
collected data that does pertain to healthcare as well.  This data have been opened up from 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers
for Disease Control.

### Data sharing
In order for data to be relevant and allow for trends to be seen, there
needs to be a fairly large sample size. Typically, this data is kept in
house and is collected at hospitals and doctors' offices. While this
data set is large, it is not nearly large enough. In order to create a
good sample of data one would want to aggregate as much as possible.
Realistically regional, or national data sets would work best until a
global effort is put forward to collect and utilize data from every
location possible. Until that day comes the best way to create these
data sets is by sharing findings at health-information exchanges. 

These events allow the sharing of millions of electronic medical files.
However, for the patient's privacy all these records are stripped of
their names and any other type of identifiers. That allows for the data
to be safely shared with other physicians and those studying the data.
With this collection of data the ability to see what types of treatments
work for different types of people is helping develop specialize
treatment for individuals.

## Medical Internet of Things
The medical internet of things is an emerging field where data is
collected from devices on or near the patient. These devices have senor
that sense various things such as blood pressure, electrocardiograms,
movements and so much more. These devices can interact with the internet
and have results be viewed from anywhere the internet is available.
Currently available to everyone are smart wearables such as Fitbit or
apple watches. These commercial devices can give ample insight to a
patient's day to day lives so doctors can possibly help patients adjust
their life style to attain better health. These devices log you resting
heart rate, your exercise and steps taken, food intake, water intake,
weight gain or loss, sleeping schedule, and sleep quality. This
information alone can enable a physician to give corrective changes to
help someone lose weight or, sleep better at night or possibly spot a
potential problem by seeing their results. 

With medical internet of things doctors' visits will become more efficient, 
less frequent. The doctor will be able to monitor trends in recovery and treatment and
schedule appointments based on those trends. Even further still the
in-office appointment may become unnecessary due to virtual doctor
visits which can be done from the comfort of a patient's home. This
saves the doctors and patients time and money yet still allows for more
effective care than an in person visit.

### Doctors Visit

Under normal procedures a doctor visit can seem repetitive in nature.
First the vitals are taken, then a brief talk with the nurse over the
reason for the visit and then the doctor comes in and reviews the
information gives an examination and takes some sort of action. The
action could be a new prescription or possibly asking for some procedure
or lab to be done, or even possibly referring a specialist. 

All of these tasks seem rather repetitive but soon the landscape of a doctor's
appointment will change. Doctors and nurses will have the medical
history and vitals all at the touch of screen. In a hypothetical
situation one could get the vitals taken care of, that information would
be uploaded to a secure database. That information then could be sent to
a central location where the electronic medical record could be
accessed. To which the nurse and doctor would have access and be able to
review and assess before even waling into the room. With this
information they will already have a general idea of the needs of the
patient and be able to take the correct actions quicker and more
efficiently [@Dimitrov2016IOT].

### Evolution of Health Applications

It was not long ago, that if you had a problem that there was an
application out there that could not solve it. That stands true today.
Most health apps are for tracking goals as well as certain vitals, but
now the applications are pushing further beyond that. Now these health
applications are becoming more specialized. There is application company
named Canary Health which is specializing in prediabetes prevention. The
application changes the eating habits as well as physical activity of
the patient to become healthier and possibly no longer be prediabetic.

Applications such as this not only help patients get healthier and save
money. They also help the overall health care system preform better and
save them money as well in the process. Chronic diseases such as
Diabetes can cause a multitude of problems for patients and hospitals a
like. These applications if utilized correctly will help save lives and
unneeded expenses.


### Pharmaceuticals

As far as a place of pharmaceutical companies in medical internet of
things, they have decided to stay in a very specific segment of the
industry. Aside from prescriptions their main area of concentration is
through researching outcomes of drug usages. Using smart devices to
track clinical trials patient care allowing them to create more
effective products for patients. Pharmaceuticals is also pushing itself
beyond the use of just drug creation, now they are pushing for more
creative ways to implement and administer treatments. This includes the
use of sensor and hardware. For instance, instead of having to take
insulin for someone who is diabetic, what if there was a sensor that was
able to tell when the glucose levels were shooting up too high and had
something that automatically released insulin into the blood stream
without having the patient doing a single thing. Essentially curing the
disease in some manner, having sensors, medication and hardware work in
tandem to do what the body was originally intended to do. The
applications for this could be very helpful for seniors who forget to
take medication, or forgot they took medication. If there was an
automated system to release drug into the body, it could save seniors
from accidental overdose. In addiction these systems could help those
who have pain issues, manage their pain appropriately and possibly help
curb the opioid epidemic that is happening at the time of this paper.

## Data Mining

With all the data available there must be a way to make sense of it all.
This is done through data mining.  Data mining at its core is looking at
large amounts of data and extracting meaningful knowledge from it.
Usually patterns can be extrapolated form that a data to help predict trends,
or specific data points or events. Data mining usually is something that is
usually in done in tandem with Big Data analytics.  Big Data is based off the three
V’s which are volume, velocity and variety.  

When it comes to the complexity of healthcare data, big data almost sounds like to
small of a term.  There are large amounts of data that is being converted from past
records and combined with the ever-growing amount of data being produced makes this
data not just big, if anything massive is a better descriptor.  If you couple with that
the velocity of the information itself, which covers everything from real time, to batch
processes the data being collected very quickly.  Then to top it all off the variety of
healthcare data is quite extreme as well.  This means electronic medical records, pharmaceutical
studies, x-rays, MRI’s, and an assortment of other types of data to work with.

With this Big data in the medical field, it is possible that there are a multitude of medical
discoveries waiting to be discovered.  At the very least there are some answers on how to improve
the healthcare experience allowing for cheaper and more effective healthcare than is known by today
standards. In fact, it seems that due to big data in healthcare the paradigm is shift from a
disease-centered model towards a patient-centered model.  


### Disease Centered Care

Before the revolutionization of big data in healthcare, physicians made decisions based
on several factors.  They had their educations, expertise and accrued wisdom, reference
books and cohorts to help draw logical conclusions to solve the patient’s issue.  Doctors,
being only human, are prone to error, and though highly trained can come to the incorrect
diagnoses. In some cases, this type of error can lead to death or unneeded labs and procedures
which can in turn cost either the hospital, doctor, or patient potentially large amounts of money.
This type of treatment while all that was available before the big data revolution is now shifting
towards patient centered care.

### Patient Centered Care

While Diseases centered care is more about knowledge that only physicians acquire and use to help
patients receive proper treatment; patient centered care is about allowing the patient to be more
in charge of their actual care.  While we will never replace doctors or the knowledge and skills 
they learn in the medical field, the way they provide treatment may change.  With patient centered 
care it is more about choices presented to the patient to decide how they wish to proceed with their
treatment and the doctor is a guiding professional.  This puts more responsibility on the patient to be
proactive about their healthcare, rather than just being told by a doctor what issues are being faced
and what to do to fix them.  

When it comes to patient centered care data is the key.  This means more personalized treatment not
based off population-based statics. This personalization would come from people who are similar to
the patient and the issues that they face and the treatments that worked best for them.  This type of
data gives the best choices for that type of person and not for the disease or issue itself.  


### CARE: A Patient-Centric Personalized Healthcare Framework

Here is a possible example with the use of data mining in big data to create a possible application
for patient centric healthcare.  This framework allows for patients to get an in-depth look into their
current health status.  Not only that but the possibility of future issues or complications they may
face based on their personal type of profile.  In addition, these assessments could allow the patient
to be vigilant and on the look out for warning signs of possible symptoms.  Though being able to spot
possibly predisposed diseases seems nice, these assessments would also include proactive step to 
possibly, reduce the risk of the disease or condition or possibly not getting the disease or condition
at all. 

How would this system be constructed and how would it function? The answer in this case is in the 
name itself.  Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine (CARE) 
[@Chawla2013PersonalizedHeathcare].  The premise of this framework is to create essentially a 
Netflix base data system in which the patient data from various others is aggregated and compared 
to the current patient’s information.  This allows for the patient type to see how other patients 
have developed certain diseases and what factors lead to it as well. 

The real question to ask for a product like this is; will the patient use this data to change 
their health outcome?  Only time and data can help reveal if this use of data will produce outcomes. 
However, given the human species and most species are creatures are on of habit, the intended outcome 
may not succeed fully. Most will not act unless the situation is immediate, and currently affecting 
them.   That is not to say that this system will not have positive outcomes for some, just that the 
majority will do nothing with the information they are presented.  This model is something that would 
truly help in an ideal world where patients indeed take care of themselves.  

## Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare
Analytic data has its place in the healthcare industry and has made major strides 
in helping the medical field keep up and understand its data.  There are many 
tools that help its intake and gain understanding to help the patients, doctors, 
payors, and pharmaceutical companies achieve efficient and proper care.  However, 
that is not enough to truly transform the healthcare industry, and it would be a 
was of data if artificial intelligence were not to be utilized in such a complex 
and demanding field.


### Defining Artificial Intelligence

In most cases definitions of terms is often boolean.  It is either what it is 
defined as, or it is not.  Though there are quiet a few definitions that seem 
to be hard to define.  Artificial intelligence falls under this category.  Since 
the term was initially coined in 1955, defining its actual meaning has become 
somewhat of a difficult task.  The original idea behind artificial intelligence 
was the ability to make a machine perform task as an intelligent human being would.  
However, this raises many questions of its own, such as how do we qualify intelligence 
and what does intelligence even mean[@kaplan2016Artificial]? The definition of 
artificial intelligence is still being debated and which complicates its meaning 
for this paper.  For simplicity, Artificial Intelligence in this paper will refer to 
the ability of a program which is able to listen, see and understand information, 
which is then processed as learning, as well as being taught by way of human 
corrections.  Programs such as these, and like humans, are always learning, but 
have far better memory recall and learning ability than humans, but only when taught.  

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence

The applications of Artificial intelligence are far reaching.  It can simplify 
a doctor visit or regulation compliance or even predict someone who is at risk 
of self-harm or suicidal.  Artificial intelligence is prevalent in many other 
applications and will become ubiquitous in the healthcare industry, relieving 
doctors of extensive paperwork, and allowing them to concentrate on the patient, 
being a better pair of eyes in reviewing imaging results, to detecting things 
only a computer program could.  Reviewing the different ways, it is being used 
with show how revolutionary it will be in the healthcare industry.

### Clinical Documentation Improvement

Clinical documentation has come quite a long way from where it once was.  A field 
that has moved from hand written notes, orders and prescriptions, to almost being 
completely digitally based.  This no doubt has helped improve the records for patients 
and has helped doctors with treating them.  However, as time has passed with the advent 
of the electronic health record so have problems with them. The main issue with electronic 
health records is they hold a large amount of complex data in many different areas. Though 
this is a very detailed and thorough account for the doctor and patient and is very important 
for every stakeholder.  Completing this electronic medical record can often cause great 
strain on the physician to complete it in timely manner.  A recent study of fifty-seven  different 
types of doctors show they spend 49% of their time filling out records; twenty-one of those 
doctors ended up having to complete the records after hours [@Sinsky2016EMRStudy].

This research clearly indicates that there is a problem with the way doctors have to intake 
patient data.  There maybe some factors of user interface and design that make these records 
hard to navigate and complete. However, even if those issue were addressed, would it be enough 
to make an impact, and free up physicians time and work load so they can concentrate on 
listening to the patients need, while allowing a proper work life balance as well; thus, 
contributing to a better doctor patient experience.  Furthermore, new designs and changing 
models may require more time and training, and possibly costing more money for upgrades to 
the software.  At this crossroad artificial intelligence maybe the answer.  There are a multitude 
of ways this could help save hours of time spent normally logging information and allow for 
bettering communication between patients and doctors.  

### Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing is an ever-improving framework within the 
artificial/machine learning field.  It is the use of taking structured 
or unstructured text data and creating meaning out of it. It is used 
in a variety of ways.  From being able to tell if a vast number of 
tweets are negative over a certain topic by analyzing the value of words 
used. In the medical field that is just one of the ways it can be used.  
However, the uses of natural language processing in healthcare could 
indeed revolutionize more than any other technology available.  It sits 
at the intersections of the healthcare industry and stand in a location to 
make considerable changes that will save lives, save time and save money.  
The two areas where natural language processing stands to make the most 
impact is with electronic health records and in the area of clinical 
decision support. Though there are other areas that one could focus, these 
show the best promise for the technology.

### Improving Upon Electronic Medical Records

Electronic medical records have changed the landscape of the medical field 
forever. From hand written notes, and knowledge held by few to now digital 
records that hold all patient data in one place, and sharable with doctors 
and providers who need the information.  It’s ability to store all this data 
is extremely useful, however it is also one of its biggest down falls.  The 
structures of these electronic health records are extremely complex and to 
input all the correct data into them is a time consuming and tedious task 
that doctors need to complete.  This is becoming an issue when it comes to 
patient and doctor interactions.  With the amount of time these records take 
to fill out, much more time could be spent with the patients and important 
work could be done.  Rather than doctors spending almost half of their time 
on documentation alone.

There are currently two methods that are developing for natural language 
processing trying to solve current issues with filling out electronic health 
records.  One is the use of speakers that listen to the doctor patient 
conversations to increase the quality of interactions between patient and 
doctor.  The second option is the use of natural language processing to go 
over doctors note in the electronic medical record.  Both have strengths and 
weakness, yet they both achieve the same goal for the most part.

#### Taking Notes

For most doctors that are practicing medicine today, electronic medical records 
are still a relatively new concept.  Before the use of pen and papers and forms 
were all that was needed.  Now with electronic medical records that has changed 
a bit.  However, they still end up taking notes in the records themselves and 
then proceed to fill out the information in the record they need for compliance 
and reimbursements. The redundancy coupled with he complexity of the document 
takes the doctors far too much time.  Where the natural language processing comes 
in to play is the notes [@www-Bresnick2016NLP].  What if all the doctor had to do 
is take notes and the program used those to fill in the rest to the electronic 
medical record?   This could save the doctor an extraordinary amount of time, 
compared to how they are doing things now. The issue with this method is that 
the doctor is still taking notes.  

#### Listening to Patients

Taking notes, while a crucial skill, is time consuming, and takes a good amount 
of concentration.  Doctors often take notes while in the room with that patient, 
which takes away from the interaction in which a doctor may miss crucial 
information while taking notes.  Alternatively, they could take notes after 
talking with the patient, but how accurate is the information after being out of 
the room?  Both of these options seem to leave gaps in the care in one way or 
another.  That is why Nuance Communications has created new speakers and software 
to do the note taking, so the doctors can concentrate on the patient.  This product 
will be able to tell apart up to eight different people and be able to keep track 
of the individual’s position, so the speech is attributed to that person 
[@www-Bresnick2019NLPSpeakers].  In addition to taking notes from the doctor 
and patient interactions, it then takes those notes and puts it the relevant 
information into the document, essentially removing the duty of documentation all 
together for the physician.  This increases the relation ship between the doctor 
and patient, increases communication, and eliminates note taking, and documentation work.  

#### Challenges for Natural Language Processing

As of the time of this paper, Natural Language Processing, though having come a 
long way and from being advanced by many, is still a work in progress.  It is making 
strides in its development, but its accuracy is still a key issue.  When it comes to 
unstructured data such as doctors notes it can be extremely difficult to make sense 
of it all.  This is partially due to some words needing context in order to understand 
the meaning.  The other issues are abbreviation which may be used, by doctors, in which 
case some abbreviations have multiple meaning.  Unstructured notes raise a lot of 
accuracy concerns, making it not a good primary option currently.

Conversely, the future of natural language processing, takes data from not notes, 
but from people talking in which case creates more structured data.  This makes 
its adoption into the medical field much more likely and in 2020 there is a system 
set to be release.  For its full adoption it needs to be extremely accurate, 
considering even small mistakes in healthcare can lead to complications, lawsuits 
and death.  However, it seems there should be some reservations about this technology.  
Patients could feel being eavesdropped upon, having a listening device in a doctor’s 
examination room.  Usually a place you do not have the feeling of external observation 
and where one would feel safe.  However, it is not all that different from having an 
Alexa, google home or even carrying a cell phone.  It will be curious of how patients 
perceive this new technology and it effects.   Also, physicians should be critical 
of is product until is has proven that is accurate in its translations and its 
understanding of meanings of words.
