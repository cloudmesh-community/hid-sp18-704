  abstract      = {Faced with unsustainable costs and enormous amounts of under-utilized data, health care needs more efficient practices, research, and tools to harness the full benefits of personal health and healthcare-related data. Imagine visiting your physician's office with a list of concerns and questions. What if you could walk out the office with a personalized assessment of your health? What if you could have personalized disease management and wellness plan? These are the goals and vision of the work discussed in this paper. The timing is right for such a research direction---given the changes in health care, reimbursement, reform, meaningful use of electronic health care data, and patient-centered outcome mandate. We present the foundations of work that takes a Big Data driven approach towards personalized healthcare, and demonstrate its applicability to patient-centered outcomes, meaningful use, and reducing re-admission rates.},
