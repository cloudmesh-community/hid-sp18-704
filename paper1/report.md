##Abstract:
This paper will give an overview of how big data is used to collect and
process data about our oceans in better ways to understand it and how to
solve complex issues surrounding it.

##Introduction


Ever since man as first seen the ocean, it has always had an air of
mystery to it. Even now in the age of information, we still barely know
anything about it. This paper is to give an overview of how and with
what we are collecting the data and the problems we face in that
collection of data. In the hope that we can start to uncover the
mysteries that hide below the surface. To collect this data there is a
use of many different sensors. [@NOAA]

**Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler:**

This tool measures the speed and direction of ocean currents using
the principle of Doppler shift. Measuring currents is a fundamental
practice of physical oceanographers.

**Technologies for Ocean Acoustic Monitoring:**

This technology listens to the ocean for all sounds, boats, sea
animals, waves, siezmic activity.

**The Bushmaster and the Chimneymaster:**

A collection net used to grab tube worms or living fauna near
geothermal vents. These tools are typically attached to a
submersible vessel.

**Clod Cards:**

These plaster cards track the motion of water for benthic organisms.
The organisms that inhabit the bottom of the ocean. allowing us to
learn more about the harder to reach parts of the ocean.

**Drifters:**

Drifters, are essentially devices that flow with the current of the
ocean. Allowing for them to be mapped and visualized.

**Geographic Information Systems:**

Essentially the creation of 3D modeling within an computer
environment of the ocean.

**Satellites:**

Can detect and observe the ocean characteristics.

*Semipermeable Membrane Devices:*

Used to collect various microbes for analysis of bacteria
environment.

**Sonar:**

Uses sound to detect area around a submersible, and well as figure
out water depth.

**Sonde and CTD:**

Collect data on a multitude of things, primarily temperature at
different depths and conductivity of the water.

These sensors and technologies are what help make the data we can use to
analyze and help predict our oceans health and patterns. All of these
tools collect different data, from the directions of currents,
temperatures, bacteria, as well as mapping data. With all of this
information, it is now becoming a challenge to ask the right questions
of it. That is the main issue in the field right now is about asking the
right questions. With the oceans being the least explored and mysterious
place on earth we are very unsure how the system works as a whole and
the cause and effect major events have on it.

##Problems the Ocean Faces


The ocean, is a big an complex ecosystem, no only that, but is rather
sensitive to change. Given humanities treatment of the ocean and it
inhabitant, it has taken quite a few damaging blows to say the least. As
of now there are multiple threats to the ocean. There is the climbing
temperatures, which effect the coral reefs and ocean level. The ever
present amount of plastic in the ocean. From large vortex patches in the
middle of the oceans that are miles wide, to the small micro plastics
fish are eating, and intern are being eaten by us. Not to mention the
catastrophic effects of the multiple oil spills, and bleaching incidents
that are destroying the coral reef habitats. Which coral reefs have two
fold purpose, one is the habitat, the second is the reef itself which
helps remove a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These are the
most pressing issues as of right now but there are many more. With the
use of big data and collection through the sensor above we can start
learning how to take action and where.

##Collection Efforts


As of right now the collection of data is not a collective effort
globally. [@Delgnrain] However there are many organizations that are
doing their best to collect and analyze the data. One of these
organizations is The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Which
is collecting massive amounts of off coastal based laboratories. The use
of data is to help get an unbiased amount of data to help predict the
health of the ocean and its effect on climate change and rising sea
levels. That way it can help coastal cities and states, plan for the
future within the next couple decades.

Even with organizations like this around the globe, there is still not
enough data to truly predict and know the health of our oceans. It will
take a global effort and many more sensors, and a lot more interest from
the public. This will help with funding for the scientist and the tools
that will need to be developed and maintained for future exploration.

With enough data we could finally see how our planets oceans work. It
could help choose the best route for boats, based off currents. It could
help prevent major disasters by helping cities, states, countries be
prepared for hurricanes weeks in advanced. It would allow us to see how
events in different parts of the globe would have an effect elsewhere.

##The Data


As with any situation where massive amounts of data are involved, things
can get bit complicated. In the case of ocean data, you have data from
multiple sources. Ranging from satellites, to buoys, to bacterial
analysis. Not only that but the complexity with all of this data is that
the ocean is one of the most dynamic things on earth. Unlike things on
land, though always moving, are usually predictable. The ocean does not
give any such luxury as it is all connected and always in motion. Given
this fact, it is hard to collect data for the ocean as a whole. At least
for right now. However, it is possible to get fairly reliable data for a
set area.

##Integration

Making sense of all this data is the main issue that most scientist
face. So integration is a primary concern. When modeling the data
especially there is a lot of work to make the data come together and
makes sense. In one case for modeling salinity of different parts of
coastal regions, they match up GPS data points and observations and time
with the data from the senors that collect it. The matching of all this
information allows you to integrate the data together for correct
mapping of a given location. [@Liu2016] This is just a small example of
the amount of effort to pull all the data together to produce
visualization of those results

##Solutions

Though the efforts have not come together globally as of yet, plans to
make that happen are in motion. Just this June, the United Nations met
for a week long discussion on how to make our oceans healthier with
emphasis on global cooperation. [@Woody] Unlike the pairs agreements for
global warming, this meeting will not come to a signed contract, rather
an understanding that be every country will to be accountable for some
part of the oceans health. And encourage international cooperation to
help solve our biggest issues.

##Hopeful Future

At this point there is no clear cut solution to solve all issues that
face our oceans. And we may never collect all the data that we need to
make the most informed decision. However with the data collected thus
far is clear that we need to do. And though we do not have it all the
answers, we have enough data to start asking the important questions to
set us on the right track.

The authors would like to thank Professor Gregor von Laszewski and all
the TA's for their help. As well as other students and their
contribution to collective learning.
